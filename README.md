# GagosianEntryScript
24Hr Only Entry Script.

Required Libraries:

-random
 
-time

-bs4

-string

-requests
  
Run this as much as you want. 
You may change the delay near the bottom to prevent bans or not for lots of entries.
If requested I can add proxy support.

To use:

-Make sure required libraries are installed (Uses Python 3+)

-Change the email variable to whatever the beginning of your email is (Ex. testing123@gmail.com; the beginning would be 'testing123')

-Make sure you use a gmail. This script uses the +char function to get multiple entries to your email. It's possible to change the email    to a catchall if you'd like to.

-Thats it. Start the thing and put your number of entries in to begin.
  
  
 Catchall Support has been added.
  
 To use proxies with the Catchall, a have them be read by the script like this: http://ip:pass or if they're User:Pass, use is like this:  http://user:pass@ip:password
