# GagosianEntryScript
24Hr Only Entry Script.

Required Libraries:
  -random
  -time
  -bs4
  -string
  -requests
  
Run this as much as you want. 
You may change the delay near the bottom to prevent bans or not for lots of entries.
If requested I can add proxy support.

To use:
  -Make sure required libraries are installed (Uses Python 3+)
  -Change the email variable to whatever the beginning of your email is (Ex. testing123@gmail.com; the beginning would be 'testing123')
  -Make sure you use a gmail. This script uses the +char function to get multiple entries to your email. It's possible to change the email    to a catchall if you'd like to.
  -Thats it. Start the thing and put your number of entries in to begin.
